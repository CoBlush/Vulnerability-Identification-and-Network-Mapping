<p>PART#2: You are a network professional on the IT team at Alliah Company, a rapidly growing social media provider. A year ago, Alliah launched a social media platform targeting young professionals, accompanied by a mobile app for accessing the site via smartphones. The website was funded through a crowd-funding campaign, but the majority of the budget was spent on website and app development, leaving minimal resources for the office's internal network infrastructure.

Alliah employs 35 full-time staff, all working in a three-story building that serves as the company headquarters. This building, a converted 10,000-square-foot warehouse, currently accommodates employees on two floors, with the third floor available for future expansion.

The company's WLAN setup includes a gigabit managed switch, a multiservice wireless LAN controller, and seven wireless access points positioned to provide full coverage for staff. One access point extends coverage to a large outdoor patio area for employees. The network is secured by a firewall, and the websiteâ€™s servers are hosted in a data center 100 miles away from the headquarters.

Five of the employees are account representatives who spend 80% of their time traveling, each equipped with a company-issued laptop, tablet, and smartphone. When in the office, they work from a shared space. All staff use company-provided computers connected to the WLAN, but to save costs during the launch phase, Alliah adopted a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy.

The IT department consists of five team members: three focus on maintaining the website, one manages the office's computers and network, and the fifth supports both the website and the network. The team remotely accesses the website servers via wired Ethernet connections.

The Alliah website's growing popularity brings in more visitors each month. Jennifer, the CEO, plans to expand the team and is considering taking the company public within a few years. In preparation, she wants to ensure the wireless network is highly secure and capable of scaling quickly. Jennifer is also evaluating the security risks associated with continuing the BYOD policy versus restricting network access to company-owned devices, or possibly finding a balanced approach. </p>
